Error when writing grammar tables?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might see some errors about writing grammar tables when using the black formatter, simply manually create the directory as suggested in `here`_ and you should be good to go.

Why are the commands not showing up in the command pallete?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure you really have one of the formatters properly installed.

And also make sure you have a suitable notebook/script opened for the formatters to work on when checking if the commands are there.
